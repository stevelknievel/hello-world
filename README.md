What's happening GitHubWorldPeople?  Stevelknievel here, and this is my first attempt at using GitHub.  I'm learning to code and pretty excited about it.  

I also like nachos, manual transmission cars, and going to concerts.  Never had nachos at a concert.  I suppose that's a goal.  I LOVE my family (wife, two boys) and also Chicago.  I'm from there and don't mind the cold.  Really.  You just need good gear.
